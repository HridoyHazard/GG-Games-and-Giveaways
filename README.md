<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Most gaming clients nowadays offer free games very often (Specially EPIC) and I've always found it hard to check all the stores out every week. I wanted an app that would notify me when a game goes free. After a lot searching around, I decided to make my own. Through this app, you can see all available free games and active giveaways and get notified when a game goes free.

### Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

There are still a lot bugs to fix and a lot of new features to implement. Some of my goals are:

- [ ] Implement a good filtering system so that uses can filter by platform, release date, etc.
- [ ] Add better notification system (Open the app after user taps on the notification)
- [ ] Add monetization?

Go to the [open issues](https://github.com/ikramhasan/GG-Free-Games-and-Giveaways/issues) to report a bug or request a feature.
